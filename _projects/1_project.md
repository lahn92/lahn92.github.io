This was a quick project, completed over two afternoons of work. The logo was made first using a CNC router with 1/16 inch and 1/32 inch 2-flute bits, before finishing on the lathe to give the head of the brand its final shape. The 8 mm steel rod was glued into a wooden block, before the handle was shaped on the lathe, sanded, and finished with Australian oil. Afterwards, the head was threaded on, and the project was finished.
