<h3>Introduktion</h3>
This project was developed as part of my work at Aarhus University. It is a remote-controlled boat designed to operate near glacier fronts, where it is unsafe to deploy a manned platform. The boat is primarily intended to carry a submersible methane probe, but it can easily be retrofitted to accommodate other payloads.

<h3>The plan</h3>
My general plan was to upgrade to a backlit screen and add USB-C charging and a battery to the console. Due to the condition of the console, I also decided to change the shell of the GameBoy. I opted for parts from [funnyplaying](https://funnyplaying.com/) as it was possible to get a shell and laminated IPS screen that didnâ€™t require modifying the shell for the screen to fit.

<h3>The work</h3>
Due to the selected parts, the amount of work to put the modded GameBoy together was minimal. It only took a short Friday afternoon after work. The most complicated part was the soldering needed for the new display overlay controls, which consisted of three wires that allowed the overlay to be controlled with the GBA buttons instead of the touch sensor built into the screen.

After that, it was mostly a matter of putting the parts in the right spots and screwing everything together.

<h3>The results<\h3>

Once the back shell was screwed down, I was left with a fully modded GameBoy Advance.
