<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project was developed as part of my work at Aarhus University. It is a remote-controlled boat designed to operate near glacier fronts, where it is unsafe to deploy a manned platform. The boat is primarily intended to carry a submersible methane probe, but it can easily be retrofitted to accommodate other payloads.
