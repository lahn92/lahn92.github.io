<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project was developed as part of my work at Aarhus University. It is a remote-controlled boat designed to operate near glacier fronts, where it is unsafe to deploy a manned platform. The boat is primarily intended to carry a submersible methane probe, but it can easily be retrofitted to accommodate other payloads. Sadly most pictures and documentation was lost when i left my job so cant say to much. but what i can say is that the the boat used Ardupilot running on a CubePilot Black with RTK GPS in moving baseline for yaw. and used bluerobotics T500 thruster for power. running on a 24 volt system.
The winch is a blue robotics Fathom Spool with a custom designed hub allowing if to be retrofitted with a winch motor.
