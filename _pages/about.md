Hi, my name is Jakob H. Lahn. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering at Aarhus University in the summer of 2024. My main areas of interest include mechatronics, robotics, design, manufacturing, and fabrication. I especially enjoy the design process—taking an idea through rapid prototyping, iteration, and refinement until the details fall into place.

Beyond my professional work, I’m an avid maker, always exploring new techniques and projects. My toolbox includes woodworking, metalworking, electronics and PCB design, microcontroller programming, CNC machining, and 3D printing. These skills support both my personal projects and my professional work. As part of this passion, I am an active member of[Open Space Aarhus.](https://osaa.dk/)

Outside of engineering, I am also a certified scuba diver. Diving gives me a way to be social, relax, and reset my mind.

Feel free to explore my[projects,](/projects/) to get a glimpse into the work that excites me—from academic and professional designs to personal creations. This site is a reflection of my journey as an engineer, maker, and lifelong learner.
