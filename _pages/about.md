Hi, my name is Jakob H. Lahn. I am finishing my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from Aarhus University in the summer of 2024. My areas of interest include mechatronics, robotics, design, manufacturing, and fabrication. I enjoy the design process, especially when a design is quickly iterated and refined through rapid prototyping and fine-tuning of the details.

Beyond my professional work, I am an avid maker, always experimenting with new techniques and projects. I have experience in woodworking, metalworking, electronics and PCB design, programming of microcontrollers, CNC machining, and 3D printing. All these techniques are now part of my toolbox, which I use both personally and professionally. As part of my maker hobbies, I am a member of [Open Space Aarhus.](https://osaa.dk/)

I am also a certified scuba diver and use scuba diving as a way to be social, relax, and refocus my mind.

Feel free to explore my [projects,](/projects/) and get a glimpse into the work that excites me. From school and work-related projects to personal creations, this site is a reflection of my journey as an engineer, maker, and lifelong learner.
